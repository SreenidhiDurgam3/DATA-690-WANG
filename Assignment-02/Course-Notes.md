*setting an empty list list1 to store values

*Using for loop for 10 integer inputs

*Printing the list of values

*Printing the minimum and maximum of list using min and max 

*storing range1 as range of the list of provided values

*Printing mean as sum of values / length of list

*calculating variance with 2 different formulas - sample variance is divided by (len(list1)-1) and population variance by (len(list1))

*Standard deviation is square root of variance
